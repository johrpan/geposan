# geposan

Geposan is an R package for analyzing genes based on their position across
species. The package includes gene data from Ensembl. It provides multiple
methods to use that data to find genes that score well in comparison with a
set of reference genes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of geposan using:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("johrpan/geposan")
```

See [this page](https://remotes.r-lib.org/reference/install_git.html) for more
information on this command.

## Publication

This method and its implementation have been peer-reviewed and published in
NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics. If you use the package in your research or

## Graphical interface

Please also take a look at the interactive graphical web interface for geposan
which is available as a separate R package called
[geposanui](https://github.com/johrpan/geposanui).
